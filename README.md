# orange-sparkles

Making it easy to get an orange site up and running. See examples for a bare minimum 
version.

A thor script exists to make building a bit easier (hopefully) if you want to get more
complicated with the views and custom css/templates (which you probably do).

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
